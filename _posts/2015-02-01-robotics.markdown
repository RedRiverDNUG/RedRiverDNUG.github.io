Joe Couvillion has been involved in local robotics for 5 years. Mostly centered around the Southwood High School program. He has also assisted in competition planning for the Regional Autonomous Robotics Competition (RARC) a Cyber Innovation effort to increase STEM in local schools. Before that he worked at Microsoft as a Software Developer Engineer/Test.

There are many school programs in the Bossier/Caddo area for robotics. Joe will describe them and go over the technologies involved in each one.
