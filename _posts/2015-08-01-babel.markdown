Brian Sullivan is a senior engineer at Clear Measure in Dallas. He got his start in programming maintaining legacy mainframe applications in COBOL at a large trucking company, but quickly realized he needed to find a more productive environment in order to stay sane. He jumped at the opportunity to help transition some of those COBOL applications to .NET, and he hasn’t looked back since. He has been working with Microsoft technologies since the .NET 1.0 days, and is interested in introducing modern web development techniques to the clients he works with. Brian is recipient of the Microsoft MVP award in ASP.NET and a graduate of Harding University.

While Javascript has always been a capable language with its share of devotees, it hasn’t evolved much since its introduction. That’s all about to change. The ECMAScript 6 standard introduces a host of new features, from classes and block-scoped variables to a badly-needed module system. The best part is that you don’t have to wait for browser vendors to implement these new features; you can take advantage of them today with transpilers like babel. Come see how you can experience the future of Javascript today.
