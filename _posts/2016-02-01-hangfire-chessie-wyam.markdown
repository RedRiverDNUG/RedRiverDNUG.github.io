Topics
 
Chessie – [http://fsprojects.github.io/Chessie/](http://fsprojects.github.io/Chessie/)
 
Chessie brings railway-oriented programming to .NET.
 
Railway-oriented programming is a functional programming pattern where discrete operations are composed into a single unit of work. If any unit fails, the operation fails gracefully with the results of the operation returned to the caller.
 
Hangfire – [http://hangfire.io](http://hangfire.io)
 
Hangfire is an easy way to perform fire-and-forget, delayed and recurring tasks inside ASP.NET applications. No Windows Service required.
 
Wyam – [http://wyam.io](http://wyam.io)
 
Wyam is a highly modular and extremely configurable static content generator and toolkit.
 
Wyam is different. It's not a Jekyll clone (not that there's anything wrong with them) and it's not designed around blogs (though it's great at those too). Wyam is a static content generator and can be used to generate web sites, produce documentation, create ebooks, and much more. Since everything is configured by chaining together flexible modules (that you can even write yourself), the only limits to what it can create are your imagination.
