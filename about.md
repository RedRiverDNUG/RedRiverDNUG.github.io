Red River .NET User Group serves developers in and around the Shreveport-Bossier area. We meet the 3rd Wednesday of every month at the LSUS Technology Center. We will have free food and door prizes at each meeting, as well as a presentation on a topic relevant to .NET developers.

If you are interested in speaking at the RRDNUG, send an email to <rrdnug@gmail.com> or contact us on Twitter [@rrdnug](http://twitter.com/rrdnug).
